## 📝 Notes

- Focus on **critical features** first (authentication, real-time, matchmaking)
- **Test each feature** thoroughly before moving to the next
- Consider using **third-party services** for complex features (Pusher for WebSocket, Auth0 for authentication)
- **Document as you go** to avoid technical debt
- Set up **error tracking early** to catch issues in production

---

**Total Estimated Time**: 8-12 weeks for full implementation
**MVP Time**: 4-6 weeks (Critical + High Priority features only)

Would you like me to start implementing any specific feature from this list?
