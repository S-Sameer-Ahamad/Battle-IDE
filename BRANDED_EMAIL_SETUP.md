# Branded Email Setup for Battle-IDE

## Current Issue
Your emails are showing as coming from your personal Gmail (`shaiksameer5861@gmail.com`), which isn't professional for a platform.

## Recommended Solutions

### üéØ Option 2: Gmail with Branded Display Name - CURRENT SETUP

**What you have now:**
Your `.env` is already configured to show:
```
From: Battle-IDE <noreply@battle-ide.com>
```

But emails still send through `shaiksameer5861@gmail.com`

**Setup Steps:**

1. **Generate Gmail App Password**
   - Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - Enable 2-Step Verification (required)
   - Generate an App Password for "Mail"
   - Copy the 16-character password

2. **Update `.env` with your App Password:**
   ```env
   EMAIL_PASSWORD="your-16-char-app-password"
   ```

3. **Restart your server:**
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

**What recipients will see:**
- **From:** Battle-IDE <noreply@battle-ide.com>
- **Reply-to:** shaiksameer5861@gmail.com (in headers)

**Limitations:**
- Gmail has sending limits (500-2000/day depending on account age)
- Some spam filters may flag it
- Not suitable for high-volume production

### üè¢ Option 3: Custom Domain Email (Professional)

If you buy a domain (e.g., `battle-ide.com`), you can use:

**A) Google Workspace ($6/month)**
- Professional email: admin@battle-ide.com
- Best deliverability
- Full email suite

**B) Zoho Mail (Free tier available)**
- Free for up to 5 users
- Custom domain email
- Good deliverability

**C) Your domain registrar's email**
- Most domain registrars include free email forwarding
- Can use with SMTP

## My Recommendation

**For NOW (Development/Testing):**
Use Gmail with branded display name (already set up!)
- Just add the App Password to `.env`
- Quick to test
- No sign-ups needed

**For LAUNCH (Going Live):**
Switch to Brevo immediately
- Free tier is generous
- Professional appearance
- Better deliverability
- Takes 15 minutes to set up

**For SCALE (Established Platform):**
Get a custom domain with professional email
- Ultimate professionalism
- Full control
- Best deliverability

---

## Current Status

Your `.env` is configured with:
```env
EMAIL_FROM="Battle-IDE <noreply@battle-ide.com>"
```

This means emails will show:
- **Display Name:** Battle-IDE
- **Email:** noreply@battle-ide.com (visual only, actually sends from Gmail)

To activate:
1. Add your Gmail App Password to `EMAIL_PASSWORD` in `.env`
2. Restart server
3. Test!

Emails will look professional to recipients, even though they're sent via Gmail behind the scenes.

## Next Steps

**Right now:**
```bash
# 1. Get Gmail App Password from:
https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords

# 2. Add to .env:
EMAIL_PASSWORD="abcd efgh ijkl mnop"  # (no spaces)

# 3. Restart server:
pnpm run dev

# 4. Test:
http://localhost:3000/auth/forgot-password
```

**Before launch:**
- Sign up for Brevo (free)
- Switch SMTP credentials in `.env`
- Much better deliverability!
